# DeviceSwap React App

This is a React-based marketplace for buying, selling, and repairing devices.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/HassanMTS/ReactApp.git
	cd ReactApp
	```

2. **Install dependencies:**
	```bash
	npm install
	```

3. **Run the app in development mode:**
	```bash
	npm start
	```
	The app will open at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is in use).

4. **Build for production:**
	```bash
	npm run build
	```
	This creates a `build/` folder with the production build.

5. **Serve the production build locally:**
	```bash
	npm install -g serve
	serve -s build
	```
	Then open the provided localhost URL in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a blank page or manifest errors, make sure you are running the app with `npm start` or serving the `build/` folder with `serve -s build`.
- Do **not** open `index.html` directly in your browser; always use a local server.
- If you change the `homepage` in `package.json`, rebuild with `npm run build`.
- For Windows line ending warnings, you can safely ignore them.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
